# Rotation Cipher

### Instructions

* Write the following two functions in Python:

    * def rotate_letter(letter, n):
        * this function will take in two arguments: a letter, and a number,
        * and then rotate that letter by the given amount through the alphabet

    * def rotate_word(word, n):
        * this function will take in two arguments: a word and a number,
        * and then encrypt that word by rotating every letter through the alphabet
        * by the given amount

* For both functions, assume the input is given in capital letters.
