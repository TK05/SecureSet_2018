# WEP FMS Attack

### Instructions
* This is a difficult assignment.
* I have a listener running on 172.19.5.133, port 6000 that does the following:
    * You connect and send three bytes (for example: "\x01\xff\x7c"), and the server sends back a single byte (for example: "\xa3").
* Use RC4 and WEP to crack the five-byte key the server is holding. 


### Note
* TODO
