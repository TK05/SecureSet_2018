the

in

overview
osi

the
seven
layers
of
the
osi
model
appear
fairly
but
actually
there
is
some
gray
area
between
the
there
is
some
criticism
of
the
osi

regarding
its
relevance
to
modern
it
has
been
language
from
the
osi

has
extended
into

the

there
are
five
layers
in

do
not
exactly
match

in

there
are
some
natural

communication
you
and
i
are
comfortable
exchanging

in

we
exchange
these

by

on

other

exchange

these

are
encoded
into

how
do
i
send
you
the

at
using
computers
on
a

we
have
to
come
up
with
an
agreed
upon
way
to
turn
letters
any
other
into
and
we
will
do
this
in
turn
a
letter
the
letter
into
a
number
represent
that
number
with
and
turn

into
high

low
just
the
computer
takes
care
of
numbering
systems
going
to
figure
out
how
to
represent
a
number
with
and
to
do
we
need
to
take
a
step
back
to
talk
about
numbering
systems
numbering

base
we
are
most
familiar
with
base
thousand
hundreds
tens
and
ones
special
about

have
ten
could
we
count
with
a
different
numbering
numbering
systems
base
try
base
from
right
to
the
columns
represent
powers
of
of
eight
fours
twos
and
one
this
is
the
number
nine
in
base
or
read
this
number
as
thousand
and
would
be
base
it
should
be
read
numbering
systems
in
base
we
need
ten
digits
we
never
need
more
than
in
a
column
because
it
gets
to
the
next
column
you
already
know
this
from
elementary
in
base
we
only
need
two
digits
and
numbering
systems
how
many
digits
would
we
need
in
base
sixteen
base
is
called
we
need
sixteen
so
we
need
to
borrow
a
few
extra
f
numbering
systems
base
the
number
would
often
write
to
explicitly
say
the
number
is
in

right
to
the

powers
of
sixteens
and
f
ones
numbering

convenient
because

all
doing

would
need
to
import

into

we

of
how
