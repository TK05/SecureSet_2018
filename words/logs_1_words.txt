nagios
is
a
monitoring

created
by
ethan
it
was
originally
released
as
a
opensource
project
named
netsaint
in
due
to
trademark
issues
it
was
later
renamed
since
then
it
has
become
one
of
if
not
the
most
common
monitoring
tool
for
production
nagios
is
primarily
an
alerting
tool
that
will
notify
an
administrator
or
group
of
administrators
if
a
service
enters
a
critical
or
warning
state
if
it
has
a
basic
web
interface
that
allows
for
acknowledgment
of
issues
and
scheduling
nagios
is
highly
configurable
and
extensible
due
to
its
reliance
on
external
commands
to
perform
almost
every

test

nagios
is
a
standard
and
notifications
are
generated
by
an

of
this
nagios
does
not
restrict
the

to
using

will

those
how
to

and
how
they
can
be

to
gather
insight
into
your
graphite
the
graphite
project
is
a
set
of
tools
for
collecting
and
visualizing
all
written
in
it
consists
of
a
file
based
database
format
and
tools
to
work
with
it
called
whisper
a
set
of
network
daemons
to
collect
data
the
carbon
daemons
and
a
django
based
web
application
to
display
whisper
database
format
graphite
at
its
core
uses
a
storage
system
called
whisper
every
metric
is
stored
in
its
corresponding
these
are
fixed
sized
meaning
that
the
amount
of
data
a
file
can
hold
is
upon
in
order
to
achieve
every
database
file
contains
so
called
archives
which
store
pairs
with
varying
granularity
and
for
example
a
possible
archive
setup
could
be
to
store
a
data
point
every
seconds
for
after
that
store
minute
data
for
a
week
and
for
long
time
archival
use
a
data
point
every
minutes
for
this
means
once
your
data
is
older
than
the
time
period
stored
in
the
a
decision
has
to
be
made
how
to
fit
the
data
into
the
coarser
slots
in
the
next
in
our
example
setup
when
going
from
the
highest
precision
to
the
next
archive
we
have
values
at
our
disposal
to
the
database
can
be
configured
to
aggregate
by
max
or
min
which
uses
the
arithmetic
the
sum
of
all
the
last
one
recorded
or
the
biggest
or
smallest
value
respectively
to
fill
the
value
in
the
next
this
process
is
done
every
time
a
value
is
too
old
to
be
stored
in
an
archive
until
it
is
older
than
the
lowest
resolution
archive
available
and
stored
anymore
at
an
important
setting
in
this
context
is
the
you
can
set
on
every
this
describes
how
many
of
the
archives
slots
have
to
have
a
value
opposed
to
none
which
is
null
value
and
recorded
when
no
value
is
received
for
a
to
aggregate
the
next
lower
archive
to
a
value
and
not
also
insert
none
the
value
range
for
this
setting
is
decimal
from
to
and
defaults
to
this
means
when
we
use
the
default
setting
on
our
example
at
least
of
the
values
for
the
first
aggregation
and
of
the
values
for
the
second
one
have
to
have
actual
the
disk
format
to
store
all
this
data
is
rather
every
file
has
a
short
header
with
the
basic
information
about
the
aggregation
function
the
maximum
retention
period
the
and
the
number
of
archives
it
these
are
stored
as
longs
a
float
and
another
long
thus
requiring
bytes
of
after
that
the
archives
are
appended
to
the
file
with
their
pairs
stored
as
a
long
and
a
double
value
consuming
bytes
per
this
design
makes
it
possible
to
store
a
lot
of
datapoints
relatively
easy
and
without
consuming
a
lot
of
disk
space
worth
of
minute
data
for
a
metric
can
be
stored
in
a
little
more
than
but
it
also
means
that
some
considerations
about
usage
have
to
be
made
due
to
the
fixed
the
highest
resolution
archive
should
match
the
rate
at
which
you
send
if
data
is
sent
at
lower
intervals
the
archive
ends
up
with
a
lot
of
none
values
and
if
more
than
one
metric
are
received
for
a
the
last
one
will
always
overwrite
previous
so
if
a
low
rate
of
events
during
some
times
is
it
might
make
sense
to
tune
down
the
to
aggregate
even
if
only
one
of
ten
values
is
and
depending
on
the
type
of
metrics
for
it
might
also
make
more
sense
to
aggregate
with
the
sum
function
instead
of
the
default
aggregation
by
averaging
the
thinking
about
this
before
sending
metrics
makes
things
a
lot
easier
since
possible
to
change
these
settings
however
to
keep
the
existing
the
whisper
file
has
to
be
resized
which
takes
some
time
and
makes
the
file
unavailable
for
storage
during
that
in
order
to
understand
whisper
files
a
little
bit
we
can
use
the
set
of
scripts
distributed
with
whisper
to
take
a
look
at
a
database
first
install
whisper
from
the
pypi
sudo
pip
install
whisper
and
create
a
whisper
database
with
a
second
retention
for
minute
by
using
the
average
archive
none
none
none
none
none
none
the
resulting
file
has
six
ten
second
buckets
corresponding
to
the
retention
period
in
the
create
as
it
is
visible
from
the
the
database
uses
default
values
for
and
aggregation
since
we
specify
anything
and
we
also
only
have
one
archive
which
stores
data
at
seconds
per
value
for
seconds
as
we
passed
as
a
command
by
default
shows
timestamps
as
epoch
there
is
also
option
to
show
them
in
a
more
human
readable
but
since
the
exact
time
is
not
important
all
examples
show
epoch
for
updating
the
database
with
value
there
is
the
handy
which
takes
a
timestamp
and
a
value
as
none
none
none
none
none
notice
how
the
timestamps
are
not
the
same
as
in
the
example
because
more
than
a
minute
has
past
since
then
and
if
we
had
values
stored
at
those
they
be
show
however
taking
a
look
at
the
database
file
with
reveals
a
little
more
information
about
the
storage
meta
aggregation
average
max
archive
seconds
per
archive
in
addition
to
the
metadata
already
the
dump
command
also
tells
us
that
only
one
slot
actually
has
and
in
this
case
the
time
passed
since
slots
are
only
changed
when
new
values
need
to
be
written
to
this
old
value
will
remain
there
until
the
reason
why
show
these
past
values
is
because
it
will
only
show
valid
data
within
a
given
time
until
max
retention
from
the
invoked
point
in
and
it
will
also
fetch
the
points
from
the
retention
archive
that
can
cover
most
of
the
requested
this
becomes
a
bit
more
clear
when
adding
a
new
retrieving
all
data
from
the
archives
creating
new
whisper
migrating
renaming
old
database
renaming
new
database
average
archive
archive

none
none
none
none
none
now
the
database
has
a
second
archive
which
stores
second
data
for
minutes
and
returns
second
because
it
tries
to
retrieve
as
close
to
default
as
possible
and
the
second
slot
archive
is
closer
to
for
getting
data
in
second
the
command
has
to
be
invoked
with
the
parameter
and
an
epoch
timestamp
less
than
minute
in
the
these
commands
are
a
good
way
to
inspect
whisper
files
and
to
get
a
basic
understanding
how
data
is
so
it
makes
sense
to
experiment
with
them
a
bit
before
going
into
the
rest
of
the
graphite
the
carbon
daemons
in
order
to
make
whisper

accessible
to
be
written
to

the

the
carbon

the
suite
consists
of
a
and
which
are
all
based
on
the
twisted
framework
for
io
in
the
daemon
is
the
most
crucial
of
them
as
it
provides
the
basic
interface
to
the
whisper
backend
and
a
scalable
and
efficient
way
for
a
large
number
of
clients
to
store

order
to
minimize

delay
for
a
big

of

depending
on
the
disk

the
daemon
employs
every
metric
has
its
own
queue
and
an
incoming
value
for
a
metric
gets
appended
to
a
background
thread
then
checks
the
queues
for
data
points
and
writes
them
consecutively
to
the
storage
this
way
cost
of
an
expensive
disk
seek
gets
amortized
over
several
metric
values
that
are
written
with
one
the
daemon
relies
on
two
config

general
configuration
and
for
whisper
storage
the
general
configuration
file
contains
settings
like
network
configuration
can
listen
on
different
sockets
like
plain
tcp
and
udp
or
even
cache
sizes
and
maximum

per

in
its
these
settings
are
very
useful
when
tuning
the
carbon

the
hardware
running
but
to
get
started
the
default

from
the
example

each

has
a

a

which
will
be
matched
on
the

the

shown
above
will
match
any

be
used
as
a

generally
three
places
where

standard
error
stderr

a
file
descriptor
opened
automatically
with

for
any
new
process
on
a

system
that
is

as
a
simple
way
for
developers
to
provide

a
user
without
assuming
any
fixed
stderr
is
always
exposed
to
a
process
as
file
descriptor
if
a
process
is
launched
from
a
shell
attached
to
a
stderr
usually
appears
inline
with
the
rest
of
the

the
stderr
may
be
redirected
in
order
to
differentiate
it
from
stdout
or
to
send
it
to
a
the
find
command
often
writes
messages
to
stderr
upon
encountering

the
name
of
the

a

we
expected
a
large

is
important
to
note
that
we
used
the
append
operation
rather
than
a
single
which
would
overwrite
every
time
this
command
was
this
sort
of
redirection
is
a
feature
of
the
shell
that
is
used
quite
commonly
in
init
scripts
and
cron
tasks
to
capture
the
output
of

commands
and

to
write

extremely
flexible
log
configuration
whereas
others
might
only
allow
you
to
set

an
extremely
useful
tool
for
viewing

if
you
were
running

server
like
nginx

to
a
you
could
use

this
can
sometimes
lead
to
situations
where

to
an
inode

mechanisms
for

upon
receiving

but
quite
a
few
syslog
logging
directly
to
files
can
add
a
lot
of
complexity
to
an
application
as
close
attention
has
to
be
paid
to
the
use
of

syslog
was
created
to
provide
a
simple
logging
interface
to
application
developers
while
offloading
the
tasks
of
sorting
and
storing
logs
to
a
separate
every
message
sent
to
syslog
has
three
pieces
of

the
facility
tells
syslog

type
of

the
importance
of
the
syslog
provides
a
fixed
set
of
facilities
and
priorities
that
a
program
may
some
examples
of
facilities
examples
of
priorities
are
all
modern
linux
distributions
ship
with
a
syslog
daemon
and
most
of
them
are
to
write
messages
to
various
files
in
depending
on
their
facility
or
while
the
exact
names
of
these
files
are
not
consistent
across
different
linux
a
few
common
ones
like
and
almost
always
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
files
in
on
your
system
to
get
a
sense
of
the
types
of

available

one
of
the
advantages
of
using
a
syslog
daemon
is
that
the
format
of
log
lines
can
be
configured
in
a
single
place
and
standardized
for
all
services
using
syslog
on
a
single
in
this
every

starts
with
a

the
name
of
the
program
and
a
while
the
name
of
the
program
is
set
when
the
connection
to
syslog
is
first
the
rest
of
these
fields
are
generated
by
the
syslog
daemon
itself
and
added
to
every
many
different
syslog
implementations
exist
with
a
variety
of
configuration
mechanisms
and
design
most
current
linux
distributions
ship
with
a
syslog
daemon
that
implements
some
superset
of
the
original
unix
the
following
examples
will
use
which
is
currently
included
in
ubuntu
linux
and
according
to
manpage
derived
from
the
sysklogd
package
which
in

is
derived
from

some
standard

here
for
configuring

formatting
and
writing

places
other
than
as
soon
as
you
start
to
manage
more
than
a
couple
of
you
start
to
think
about
ways
to
aggregate
the
logs
from
all
of
those
servers
in
a
single
place
so
that
you
have
to
login
to
each
one

to
find
an
remote
log
aggregation
is
also
often
used
to
provide
an
audit
trail
for
security
events
or
a
source
of
data
that
can
be
fed
into
a
metrics
system
like
graphite
or
there
is
a
standard
protocol
for
sending
syslog
events
over
a
network
to
another
host
over
udp
port
configuring
remote
as
udp
is
connectionless
and
makes
no
delivery
syslog
messages
sent
to
a
remote
host
using
this
standard
protocol
can
be
or
intercepted
without
any
real
indication
to
the
for
these
many
syslog
daemons
implement
different
extensions
and
mechanisms
for
transporting
this
stream
the
simplest
option
is
to
replace
udp
with
tcp
to
provide
a
reliable
transport
when
configuring
syslog
attention
and
care
should
be
paid
to
security
as
syslog
messages
are
often
used
as
an
audit
trail
and
need
to
be
protected
against
eavesdropping
and
read
your
syslog
documentation
to
understand
what
options
are

no
